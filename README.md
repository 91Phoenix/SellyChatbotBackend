Traditionally, payment cards issuers offer standardized products targeting macro-clusters of customers. Therefore, cardholders can only choose between a basic product and a premium one that comes with a prepackaged bundle of additional services. As in other industries, this one size fits all strategy is being replaced by offering a wide range of additional packages which help customers customize products. However, companies are not making the most out of big bulks of customer data available, and struggle to offer value added services that match customer’s needs and habits. Eventually, companies’ contact channels are either standard, with a massive target and low cost per contact (e.g. DEM), or supported by human interaction, which is highly valuable but too expensive for mass usage (e.g. contact center).  How can companies engage and recommend their customers on a one-to-one cost-effective way leveraging on available data?
